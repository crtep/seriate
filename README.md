Is reading your email slow? Does it not involve enough ML? Seriate gets text embeddings for emails via the OpenAI API and seriates them: organizes them in a linear order that keeps similar emails together. If you want more dimensions, it can also do a 2D view with UMAP. I vibecoded it in a couple hours.

Anecdotally, this makes reading long backlogs of mostly-junk emails faster and more fun!

H/T to [gwern on LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/u2ww8yKp9xAB6qzcr/if-you-re-not-sure-how-to-sort-a-list-or-grid-seriate-it) for the idea.
